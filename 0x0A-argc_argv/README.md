In this project, I learned about utilizing arguments passed to C functions with argc and argv as well as how to use __attribute__((unused)) or void to compile functions with unused variables or parameters.

Tasks

1. Write a program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.
2. Write a program that prints all arguments it receives.
3. Write a program that multiplies two numbers.
